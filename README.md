# CMSE 822: Parallel Computing Final Project

This will serve as the repo for your final project for the course. Complete all code development work in this repo. Commit early and often! For a detailed description of the project requirements, see [here](https://cmse822.github.io/projects).

First, give a brief description of your project topic idea and detail how you will address each of the specific project requierements given in the link above.

"Graph Analysis with Parallel Computing"

- Project Description: Computational Neuroscience involves traversing neuronal connections within the brain. Many concepts are reduced to being analyzed with TDA to understand brain dynamics. Graph analysis is a key idea for this area of research
- Parallellization Strategies: shared memory with (OpenMP) and with GPUs (CUDA) -> CUDA is widly implemented in computational neuroscience and
want to know more about openMP
More information to follow after further research done into reading about graph analysis
.

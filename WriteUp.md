# CMSE 822: Parallel Computing Final Project

## Verification

For verification, the parallel and serial programs developed in this project were validated by comparing their results to the results of other serial implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm using a common graph. Below is an example graph used to validate the developed parallel algorithms.
